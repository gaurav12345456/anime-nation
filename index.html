<h1>The3 Best Anime Series of All Time, Ranked</h1>
<h4>
    From shonen to seinen, these iconic anime series have all stood the test of time and are among the very best that the medium has to offer.</h4>
    <hr/>
    <h3>The popularity of anime has exploded in the West in recent years, with streaming services like Crunchyroll and Netflix having helped to introduce viewers to some of the many great hidden gems that the medium has to offer. This includes classic anime series as well, many of which were never broadcast in the West despite their overwhelming popularity in Japan.</h3>
<h1>3.Full Metal Alchemist </h1>

<he/>
<h4><P>As far as anime adaptations go, they don't come much more faithful than Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Across its 64 episodes, it manages to remain remarkably true to the manga both in terms of the storylines that it covers and the look and feel of the visuals. Granted, as with pretty much all anime adaptations, there is a little bit of filler here and there, but it never once disrupts the narrative flow.<br/><?P>

    The relationship between Edward and Alphonse is arguably the highlight of the series, but the plot and the unexpected twists and turns that it takes are definitely a close second. After the mixed reception to the original series, most Fullmetal Alchemist fans were thrilled with the way that Brotherhood turned out and that the studio behind it had chosen to listen to earlier criticism regarding changes to the source material.</h4>

<h1>2. Naruto Shipudan</h1>
<img src="./anime/Naruto-2.avif"/>
<h4>Much like Dragon Ball, Naruto started life in the Japanese publication Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. Following its successful debut in 1999, it was eventually adapted into an anime in late 2002. The resulting series ran for 220 episodes, with the first 135 following the first part of the manga and the rest telling their own original story using unused plot elements from creator Masashi Kishimoto's original ideas.</h4><br/>

<h1>1.Dragon Ball Z</h1>
<img src="./anime/The-main-cast-of-Dragon-Ball-Z.avif"/>
<h4>When it comes to longevity, few IPs can compete with Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball, which has managed to remain popular for almost four decades now. Granted, there were some dark periods during that time such as the 18-year window between the end of Dragon Ball Z and the beginning of Dragon Ball Super. Likewise, it would be foolish to try and argue that every arc or episode of Dragon Ball has been of the highest quality. Even so, the franchise has still managed to remain hugely popular both in Japan and in the West.</h4><br/>
